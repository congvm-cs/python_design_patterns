# Python Design Pattern 

### Introduction

Design Patterns are a tools to help us solving with a structural, extendable and scalable codebase. 

Design Patterns have been depicted in Wikipedia:

```
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general __reusable___ solution to a commonly 
occuring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed 
directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be 
used in many different situations.
```

### Notes

Design Patterns are overthought needed to be implemented in every projects. Consequentially, those one become a horrible unmaintainable mess. The rule of thumb is to keep the codebase as simple as possible. Once you start developing, you will start to see patterns repeating in the codebase in which case you can go ahead and implement the relevant design patterns.

- Design pattern are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
- Do not try to force them. Bad things are supposed to happen, if done so.
- Keep in mind that design patterns are solution to problems, not solutions finding problems, so don't overthink.
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior, or else they can result in a horrible mess of code.
